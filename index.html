      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a Front-end Web Developer/Designer</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>That's an interesting question that I haven't fully figured out myself. I love being able to work from home for starters. I like working with websites and designing them(not always part of the job I know). When I create something and it works it's exciting to me. I freelance web design and logos and I love working with clients and their businesses. Making a client happy makes my day.</p>
